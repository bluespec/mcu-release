A small demo program that blinks a set of LEDs and communicates
program status by writing to RGB LEDs. Includes an example
Makefile to compile a RISC-V program for bare-metal execution.

The startup.S is meant to serve as an example for starting a
bare-metal program. The location for the stack pointer is chosen
to be at the end of a 8KB DTCM. This location is chosen so that
the startup.S would work with the smallest DTCM size (8KB).
