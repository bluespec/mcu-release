This directory demonstrates functionality of the MCU by creating a SoC comprising
of:

* MCU (mkBSCore) (16 KB TCMs)
* Debug Module (mkBSDebug)
* GPIO (mkGPIO_AHBL)
* Loader (mkLoader)

The SoC is synthesized using Vivado block design, and is realised on an
Arty-A7100T FPGA board. The GPIOs drive 16 gpios which are connected to 4 on-off
LEDs and 4 RGB LEDs on the Arty board.
